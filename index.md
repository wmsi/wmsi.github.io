## STEM Resource Site Testing Page


<a href="stem_site.html">Click here</a> to see the master branch of our STEM Site in progress

And <a href="dev/stem_site_dev.html">here's another version</a> where we prototype new features.

### CS Site
Currently our [CS Resource Table](https://www.whitemountainscience.org/resource-table) is hosted on Squarespace, which comes with a consistent theme but clunky handling of site files (ie javascript).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/wmsi/wmsi.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
