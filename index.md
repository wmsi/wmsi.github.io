## Can we use Github.io to host our Resource site?

Currently our [CS Resource Table](https://www.whitemountainscience.org/resource-table) is hosted on Squarespace, which comes with a consistent theme but clunky handling of site files (ie javascript).

[Click here](resource-table.html) to see the same site hosted on our github.io.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/wmsi/wmsi.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
